If you are reading a non-english translation of this document you will find a number of english words that are programming concepts. If these were translated to other languages there would be a lack of consistency and fluency when reading about them. In many cases you will find the literal translation followed by the english term in parenthesis `()`. For example: Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
